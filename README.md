# Project Website

This repository jekyll-ized the source code for the [Nerfies website](https://nerfies.github.io).
You only need to change the content of [index.md](/index.md). 
It's possible to only write in markdown, but you can also use HTML to achieve fancies effects.

Here is an [example website](https://shunzh.github.io/project_website/).

## Test it locally

Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), and run
```
jekyll serve
```
in this directory.
Then you can see the website at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.
